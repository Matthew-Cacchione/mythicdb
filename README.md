# MythicDB

This project will be focused around the Mythic+ system in World of Warcraft, a type of content with infinitely scaling difficulty that allows players to increase their score. The main purpose of the website is to be a resource for players to research themselves or others, as well as providing introductory information about the system for newer players.
